Generate a PDB file given the old PDB file and an address mapping file generated from CodeDefender. Not every tool that parses PDB files supports [PDB OMAP](https://github.com/getsentry/pdb/issues/17) therefore partial reconstruction of the PDB is required to support all tools (`IDA`, `WinDbg`, `x64dbg`, `Visual Studios`).

## Example

Here is an example on how you use `pdbgen2` to generate a PDB file for an obfuscated CodeDefender binary.

```
pdbgen2.exe --obf-pe=example/HelloWorld_mutated.exe --map-file=example/HelloWorld.map.cvs --orig-pdb=example/HelloWorld.pdb --out-pdb=example/output.pdb
```

This will generate a new pdb `output.pdb` in the `example/` folder.

## Precompiled

You can download a pre-compiled version of this project instead of having to build this entire project. Head over to the github releases tab.

## Building

This will generate cmake `build` folder. You can then go into `build/` and open `pdbgen2.sln`. You need to have `Visual Studios 2022` installed. It will take upwards of 30 minutes to configure, build, and install llvm.

```
cmake -B build -DLLVM_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# or
cmake -B build -DLLVM_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Delete the `build/` folder if you wish to switch between `Release` and `Debug`, then re-run the above command.
